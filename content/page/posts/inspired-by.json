It is an original text/manuscript/opinion/expression/ [Rants are opinions too]\n\n## How to submit\n* Admin of the website uses following email id: researchinidc@gmail.com\n* They can create credentials for you. This communication can be done over email\n* Once you have the credentials, you can add/publish the post. \n\n## Roles\n*Pretty much like reddit roles or wordpress roles*\n* Gl-admin: Admin role.

On the left, there you can add your content either in *rich text like MS-word* or *one can use markdown* (I think is kramdown since it is essentially a static site generator). \n* This is like wordpress, but not wordpress. This is like a flat-file static site generator but with some automation from Netlify. Hence, whenever you pubish or update the content of the site, there will be some delay (~30000 ms) to reflect the changes you made. So, please be patient as Netlify builds the website (yes, entire website within ~2000 ms, pushes it to a git repo ~20000 ms) for you using a single click. \n* Provide author link or description at the end of the article. \nExample: [Rahul Murugan Shaikh](https://your.social-media.profile) \\\n**OR**\n*The post is written by Rahul Murugan Shaikh. He studies presence of accent in students after they come from exchange. He likes to write about animals on campuses and their effect on student academmics. He can be contacted via rahulmurushaikh@gmail.com*"
